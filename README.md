### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him/his). I'm currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying Astronomy at Texas A&M University. I graduated from UT Dallas with a B.S. in Physics in 2017.

My research focuses on the orbits of Milky Way satellites and what they can tell us about dark matter and how galaxies form.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on whether the orbits of Milky Way satellite galaxies are consistent with what we expect from simulations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how read for fun again.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about astronomy, science communication, coding, applying to fellowships, or engaging with news/politics!
